Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
* First Time Visitor Goals
   1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
      1. Upon entering the site, users are greeted with a navigation barrier that explains the main purpose of the website which is to find essential services in the area. 
      2. The logo in the navbar depicts a map with a radius around it which is a visualisation of the map when results are generated.
   2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the page to find content.
      1. As the site is only one page the user need only scroll down to find the man content of the site. The user can quickly see the input bar at the top, the search button below and the interactive google map being the main content of the page.
   3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to quickly search an area and find local amenities.
      1. Directly below the navbar is a clean and easily readable input bar. The inputs are organised into 3 sections and follow an order to arrange inputs into 1 easy directive sentence. 
      2. The user has the option to select the type, radius and central location for their  search. 
      3. To generate the search there is a large search button that generates results on the map below.
* Returning Visitor Goals
   1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to perform different types of searches in different areas
      1. Beside the search button is a clear results button that clears the map and allows the user to perform another search and if they wish to select different inputs to the first search, they can do so.
* Frequent User Goals
   1. As a Frequent User, I want to find the essential services in the places that matter to them.
      1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily select the parameters that they wish to search for on the map.
      2. Within the map the user can select the icons in the map results and find the names of the services.
Further Testing

* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.

* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
Known Bugs

4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.
Forking the GitHub Repository
By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
Making a Local Clone
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
